# Lab-2

Lab2.txt contains 25 lines â€“ each line having a first name (string), last name (string), address (string), city (string), state (string), zip code (integer), phone number(string) and donation amount (double), all separated by tabs. That text file will be used by your program.

In your program, read each line of the file as a string. Then break each line into last name, first name, address, city, state, zip code and donation (You must convert from a String to an integer and to a double) Instantiate an object with those values, put that object into an array. You will need to create a class which contains First name, Last name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Phone Number and Donation as instance variables. Create all the appropriate methods for this class.

Print the objects in the Array..... Print the information as if it were a mailing label. First name then last name on one line, address on the next line followed by city, state, zip code on a third line. The fourth line will have phone number and donation. Calculate and print the total of all donations.
